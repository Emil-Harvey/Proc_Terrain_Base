<h2>Procedural Terrain & Geographic Simulation Engine</h2>

[PRO-TER GSE]

<h3>Features</h3>
This is a list of features that have been implemented in some form or another

 ♦  Procedural generation of continental landscapes with tessellating mesh
 
 ♦  Seamless & endless exploration
 
 ♦  Procedural sea animation and texturing, specular lighting and fresnel shading
 
 ♦  HD PBR texturing - albedo, specular, normal maps and heightmaps
 
 ♦  Procedural texturing based on biomes and simulated geographical features:
 
    ♦   latitutde
    ♦   altitude
    ♦   temperature
    ♦   humidity
    ♦   slope and aspect of terrain
    ♦   proximity to water
    ♦   depth below sea
    ♦   seasonal weather
    ♦   prevailing wind direction from latitude
    
 ♦  Fallen snow adding to the displacement of the terrain mesh 
 
 ♦  Tri-planar mapping for texturing steep slopes
 
 ♦  Day/night cycle based on global position, time of year and axial tilt, 
 
 ♦  variable time-scale from real-time to 1 day/second
 
 ♦  Procedural grass/foliage + wind effect
 
 ♦  Clouds
 
 ♦  Rain
 
 ♦  'Retro' colour shader (4-bit, 16-bit colour depth)
 
 ♦  2x2 Bayer dithering shader, white noise dithering
 
 ♦  Orthographic camera mode
