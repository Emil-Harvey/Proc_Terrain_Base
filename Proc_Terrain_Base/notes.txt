Seamless Terrain + "instant" terrain generation:

- generate terrain heightmap in CS, send to blank SRV ...done!
--- which thread-size : thread-count ratio is optimal?
  - what res to make the heightmap?

- terrain = heightmapped Tessellationmesh (probably equal spacing not fractional) done!

clouds- flat quad + vertical billboard above, rgba density & lighting 'PBR' (textures)
- - rain as geo shader particles

FOLIAGE
- 32x32 scale @ 56x56 resolution is fine for trees --<4:7 ratio>
-- 5 scale //<1:9 ratio> for grass? --
keep scale static, only resolution matters
 - render trees farther than grass; separate meshes, maybe separate shaders for each

'PBR billboards': need to have world-space normals

-    ( move sunlight calculation to 'per-vertex'? )
- tada!
- regenerate terrain and recenter camera when camera position > 2/3 or 3/4 of the whole plane <- kinda done this. 
-  --^ switch this to be based on view angle instead.
-  --  -- kinda done this, needs work

- what kind of lod scale? - log10 would be nice? done!

why is lofi scree texture dark? (prob bc of bit depth or something) *fixed?

Biome Texturing:
 -  Macro texture variation -- implemented but could be improved. i.e. albedo only (make albedo Tex()...)
 -  Grass chlorophyll count; green - straw colour
 -  Stone/soil geology - iron content (rustiness); soil nutrients/wetness (darker); sandiness (beige - lack of soil)
 -  water - green algae/chlorophyll concentration
 --	-	cyan colour shader underwater? (nae red)


- move exponential height to the generation function  <- done!
- Quad trees are hard -_-
